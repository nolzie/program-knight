### Plan
The plan for this project is to create an application that allows users to create gytm programs through an intuitive and enjoyable to user interface. The application will also provide the user with feedback on the some metrics of interest for the program. The project will be made using a python backend, a very simple db like sqlite and raw js, html and css with tailwind. I want to use flask or another extremely simple api interface for python. The aim is to create a good product that runs completely client side, and is minimalistic.

The themeing for the website is that of a Knight that looks over your program and protects it. So a light but deep blue and a grey colour would work well for ascents to a white background.


Here are a list of requirements.
1) Drag and drop exercises from the left hand side search bar of exercises into the calendar to program an exercise for that day.
2) Have an add exercise button that also works for adding exercises. A pop up should come up.
3) Metrics below the calendar for key aspects of the program.
4) A complete set of exercises, the main muscle group they target, and the auxiliary muscle groups. e.g. a wide grip pull up mainly hits the lats, but also hits the traps and biceps at aroun 60% efficiency.
5) A table showing how much volume a program has for each muscle group measured in sets per week.
6) A table showing the frequency between times that a muscle group is hit.
7) A Checklist for whether or not a program hits all of the key movement patterns, rows, hinges, curls, push, etc.
8) Export functionality to excel for tracking.
